# Apache Zookeeper JARs

This is an archive for Apache Zookeeper jars that you can use to build zookeeper clients. 

## Are these authentic?
Yes, I have taken these directly from the official confluent packages.

## Why store these jars here?
It is really cumbersome to look for zookeeper jars from maven repo and other archive sites.
